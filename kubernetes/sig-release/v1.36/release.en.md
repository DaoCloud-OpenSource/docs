# Kubernetes v1.36 English Draft (Writing-Day Recheck: 2026-03-19)

This draft is refreshed with upstream status rechecked on **March 19, 2026 (UTC+8)**.

## Writing-Day Upstream Status Recheck

### 1) Final release date confirmation

Current official release-cycle source still shows:

- planned v1.36 GA release date: **Wednesday, April 22, 2026**
- source: `kubernetes/sig-release` release-1.36 README
- upstream file revision checked: `sha e674160cb986b4244d1fdcafe6d499ee536626bf`

Reference: <https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.36/README.md>

### 2) Final release blog / theme / logo links

As of this recheck:

- no final v1.36 release blog post is published in `kubernetes/website` blog post folder for 2026
- no final v1.36 logo assets are published in `kubernetes/sig-release/releases/release-1.36/logo` (only `.gitkeep`)
- there is still an open WIP mid-cycle/release PR: <https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/54866>

Therefore, final official blog/theme/logo links are **not available yet**.

### 3) Final CHANGELOG-1.36.md and release-notes changes

### CHANGELOG-1.36.md (upstream status)

Current changelog still contains pre-GA entries:

- `v1.36.0-alpha.2`
- no final `v1.36.0` GA section yet
- upstream file revision checked: `sha 37cd7afb115a346467ab778cd9a3104140c65c7a`

Reference: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.36.md>

### release-notes-draft.md (upstream status)

Current draft still has expected pre-GA structure:

- `Urgent Upgrade Notes`
- `Deprecation`
- `API Change`
- `Feature`
- `Bug or Regression`
- upstream file revision checked: `sha d8abece0a18ba0c65eda46bea130b499cc9fe3b1`

Reference: <https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.36/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md>

## Executive Summary

Kubernetes v1.36 is in late-cycle pre-GA state. The strongest current signal is not a finalized marketing narrative yet, but the technical direction:

1. policy and API machinery maturity continues (notably `MutatingAdmissionPolicy` and protobuf cleanup)
2. storage/DRA capabilities keep moving toward production use
3. node/scheduler changes require plugin and controller compatibility validation before upgrade
4. deprecation/removal items (`gitRepo` plugin, flex-volume integration path in kubeadm) need explicit operator attention

## Highlights Reported In `kubernetes/sig-release#2958`

`kubernetes/sig-release` discussion [#2958](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/2958) contains cross-SIG release highlights. The features below were explicitly called out there and rechecked against current enhancement metadata on **March 23, 2026 (UTC+8)**.

### KEP-4858: IP/CIDR Validation Improvements (Beta)

This change tightens validation so non-canonical IP/CIDR forms are rejected more consistently, reducing ambiguity between API input, controller logic, and network policy behavior. For operators, the main impact is configuration hygiene: legacy or loosely formatted addresses that previously slipped through can become upgrade blockers once stricter validation gates are enforced.

### KEP-3476: VolumeGroupSnapshot (GA target in v1.36)

Volume group snapshots extend snapshot semantics from single PVCs to related volume sets, which matters for applications that must preserve write-order consistency across multiple disks. This is particularly useful for coordinated backup/recovery workflows where training checkpoints, metadata, and model state must be captured as one logical unit.

### KEP-5538: Service Account Tokens For CSI Via `secrets` Field (GA target in v1.36)

This feature standardizes how CSI drivers receive scoped service account tokens through the `secrets` field path, reducing ad hoc credential wiring and helping operators align with short-lived token best practices. In production, it simplifies credential rotation and strengthens least-privilege boundaries between storage plugins and workloads.

### KEP-4876: Mutable `CSINode` Allocatable (GA target in v1.36)

Allowing mutable allocatable values in `CSINode` lets storage capacity signals track runtime reality instead of static startup assumptions. The practical outcome is better scheduling decisions for attach-limited environments and fewer false placements caused by stale volume-attachment limits.

### KEP-1710: SELinux Relabeling With Mount Options For Non-RWOP Volumes (GA target in v1.36)

This work improves SELinux labeling behavior for non-RWOP volume scenarios by using mount-option-based handling, lowering relabel overhead and reducing contention for shared-volume use cases. Clusters with strict SELinux enforcement can get more predictable startup behavior while keeping confinement guarantees intact.

### KEP-5040: `gitRepo` Volume Plugin Disabled In v1.36

`gitRepo` has long-standing security and maintenance concerns, and v1.36 continues the removal path by disabling it. Teams that still rely on `gitRepo` must migrate to safer patterns such as init containers, CSI-backed content distribution, or build-time artifact packaging before production rollout.

### KEP-3104: `kubectl` User Preferences (`kuberc`) (Beta target in v1.36)

The `kuberc` effort separates user preferences from cluster connection data and expands CLI behavior customization, including credential-plugin-related workflows. This improves UX consistency for platform teams that manage many contexts and helps make local `kubectl` behavior more explicit and reviewable.

### KEP-5547: Workload APIs For Job Controller (Alpha target in v1.36)

This alpha introduces workload-oriented API direction around Job execution, aiming to better express workload intent and improve controller integration patterns. For early adopters, it is primarily an experimentation track to validate API shape and controller semantics rather than an immediate production default.

### KEP-5440: Mutable Container Resources In Suspended Jobs (Beta target in v1.36)

Promoting this capability to beta allows resource requests/limits adjustments while Jobs are suspended, enabling safer queue-time tuning before execution begins. It is useful in batch/AI pipelines where capacity planning often changes between submission and actual start time.

### Scalability Signal: Tested Resource Size Raised From 800MB To 1.5GB

SIG Scalability also called out the increase in tested resource size envelope (from 800MB to 1.5GB) under ongoing scalability work. While not itself a user-facing API feature, it signals stronger confidence in control-plane handling of larger object payload scenarios and helps frame risk for large-cluster operators.

## Upgrade / Deprecation Risk Notes

From current changelog and release-notes draft signals, prioritize these upgrade checks:

1. Scheduler plugin compatibility: interface/behavior updates around `PreBind` and `PostFilter`-related mechanics require retesting for custom scheduler plugins.
2. kubeadm + flex-volume path changes: integrated flex-volume support behavior in kubeadm has changed; clusters still relying on legacy paths need migration/custom handling.
3. `gitRepo` volume plugin direction: current release-note direction indicates disabled-by-default behavior without re-enable path.
4. API/client-go behavior shifts: informer and API machinery correctness/performance changes may surface hidden assumptions in custom controllers/operators.

## AI-Infra Action List

For AI platform / AI-Infra teams (GPU and mixed training/inference workloads), use this execution checklist:

1. Runtime baseline audit: verify `containerd`, `runc/crun`, and cgroup mode by node pool.
2. Scheduler canary validation: test custom scheduling behavior against v1.36 changes with representative AI workloads.
3. DRA readiness review: confirm CRDs/controllers/device plugins are aligned with current DRA direction.
4. Storage recovery drill: validate snapshot/restore workflows for model-serving and training-state volumes.
5. Admission policy migration review: identify mutating webhook rules that can migrate to `MutatingAdmissionPolicy`.
6. Controller regression sweep: run tests for client-go informer and API behavior assumptions.
7. Network data hygiene: clean non-canonical IP/CIDR entries before stricter validation bites.
8. Progressive rollout gates: enforce staged rollout with explicit rollback and AI SLO checks.

### Any newly disclosed known issue?

Writing-day queries found **no** v1.36 known-issue ticket in `kubernetes/kubernetes` for:

- title search: `"known issue"` + `1.36`
- label/milestone search: `label:kind/known-issue milestone:v1.36`

This should still be rechecked again right before final publication.
